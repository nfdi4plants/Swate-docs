## How to use

A good starting point for your annotation is using a predefined template. You can find them under the "Protocol Insert" tab. Here, click on the "Browse protocol template database" to explore all currently available templates.

### Template search

You will be directed to the template browser where you can:

(a) **Sort** the templates according to the search input

(b) **Filter** the templates by tags.

To filter with tags, just start typing and Swate will show you related tags. Then click on the tag of interest and it will be added just above the templates. All templates shown contain at least one of the selected tags.

### Template information

When you click on a template you will be presented with some additional information, like the date of creation, the version and related tags. Swate also directly links to a docs link for each template (WIP). After selecting a template you are returned to the Swate main-page and are presented with all building blocks contained in the template. Click "Insert protocol annotation blocks" to add the template to the right side of your selected Excel cells.
