## How to use

A good starting point for your annotation is using a predefined template. You can find them under the "Templates" tab. Here, click on the "Browse database" to explore all currently available templates.

<p style="justify-content: center; display: flex">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39732517/128495178-cc14690a-fc8a-4a3c-b591-365176ea2b00.png" data-canonical-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39732517/128495178-cc14690a-fc8a-4a3c-b591-365176ea2b00.png" style="height: 300px"  />
</p>

### Template search

You will be directed to the template browser where you can:

(a) **Sort** the templates according to the search input.

(b) Filter the templates by **tags**.

To filter with tags, just start typing and Swate will show you related tags. Then click on any tag of interest to apply the filter to the templates.
- With the small slider you can decide if your filter results should contain at least one of the tags or must contain all tags.

(c) Filter the templates by **origin**.

By default the search results will contain both, community made templates and templates made by our data stewards. You can change this behaviour by hovering over the "cur/com" field and picking the behaviour you want. 

### Template information

When you click on a template you will be presented with some additional information, like the date of creation, the version and related tags. After selecting a template you are returned to the Swate main-page and are presented with all building blocks contained in the template. Click "Insert protocol annotation blocks" to add the template to the right side of your selected Excel cells. *Only building blocks not yet in your table will be added*.
