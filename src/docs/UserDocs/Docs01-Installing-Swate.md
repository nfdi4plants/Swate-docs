We currently offer different routes of installing Swate.

## Browser Installation

If you want to jump right into Swate and start testing the environment and features without much fuzz, we recommend using [Swate in your Browser](/docs/UserDocs/swate_installation_browser.html). This method uses the web version of Microsoft Excel which can be used for free with a free Microsoft account.

## Desktop Installation

If you want to use Swate in your Excel desktop application, you can use the following options:

- [Desktop Installation via installer](/docs/UserDocs/swate_installation_desktop.html) :bulb: Recommended for **Windows** :bulb:
- [Manual Desktop Installation](/docs/UserDocs/swate_installation_manual.html) :bulb: Recommended for **MacOS** :bulb: 
- [Organization-wide Desktop Installation](/docs/UserDocs/swate_installation_organization.html) :bulb: Requires administrative access in your organization :bulb:
